# Acceptance Critera
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
 WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description
I created this in a way that I slowy broke down the project into smaller bites.

I started by wokring on the HTML and getting the basics of how i wanted the page layed out

Then I picked the color pallet and worked more on the desgin and flow of the webpage

Then I worked on the CSS and making sure everything was the same and correctly inputed and had all the affects I wanted on the webpage

Then I wet through the Acceptance Critera to make sure that I had gotten all aspects of the project done and I had a fully competed project

Then I went through and made sure it worked as a deployed webpage after I did my final code check.
